Pretty Good IRC Daemon
======================

This is a feature-stripped IRC daemon similar to the now-defunct iacd.
It provides an additional set of commands to allow clients to intercept
all channel activity.  This allows a whole new range of possibilites for
bots: including something as simple as rot13-encoding all channel
discussions, to something as complex as a full MUD or MOO.
